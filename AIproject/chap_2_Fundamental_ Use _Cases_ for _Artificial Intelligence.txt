            Representative AI use cases
            ****************************
Artificial Intelligence, cognitive computing, machine learning, and deep learning are only some of the
disruptive technologies that are enabling rapid change today. These technologies can be adopted quicker
because of advances in cloud computing, Internet of Things (IoT), and edge computing.

Let's begin to look at some contemporary applications of AI:

            1 Digital personal assistants and chatbots
            ------------------------------------------
   * Google Assistant: Google Assistant was launched in 2016 and is one of the most advanced chatbots
                       available. It can be found in a variety of appliances such as telephones, headphones, speakers, washers,
                       TVs, and refrigerators.

   * Apple Siri: Siri can accept user voice commands and a natural language user interface to answer questions,
     make suggestions, and perform actions by parsing these voice commands and delegating these requests to a set of internet services.
     The software can adapt to users' individual language usage, their searches, and preferences.
     The more it is used the more it learns and the better it gets.

   * Microsoft Cortana: Cortana is another digital virtual assistant, designed and created by Microsoft. Cortana can set reminders and alarms,
     recognize natural voice commands, and it answers questions using information.

All these assistants will allow you to perform all or at least most of these tasks:

    - Control devices in your home
    - Play music and display videos on command
    - Set timers and reminders
    - Make appointments
    - Send text and email messages
    - Make phone calls
    - Open applications
    - Read notifications
    - Perform translations
    - Order from e-commerce sites
